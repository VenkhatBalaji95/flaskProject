Network adapter:
The network adapter allows the device to communicate over the local area network (LAN), connecting to the internet or to other computers.

Container runtime:

To run a container in a pod, k8's uses this containre runtime. There are three runtimes with K8's on Linux. (i) containerd, (ii) CRI-O, (iii) Docker.

Cgroup (Control group) - it is used to constrain resources that are allocated to the processes.Container runtime and Kubelet should have same cgroup driver (systemd).
In v1.22, if the user is not setting the cgroupDriver field under KubeletConfiguration, kubeadm will default it to systemd for kubelet.

To apply kubelet configuration as a part of "kubeadm init" --> kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml

Ref - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/

Configure Docker deamon to use "systemd" for the management of container cgroup's.

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF

sudo systemctl enable docker ;
sudo systemctl daemon-reload ;
sudo systemctl restart docker ;

Why to deploy Pod network to the cluster ?

You must deploy a Container Network Interface (CNI) based Pod network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other. Cluster DNS (CoreDNS) will not start up before a network is installed.

Refer: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/#pod-network

There are so many add-ons that implement the Kubernetes networking model. But, Flannel is a very simple overlay network that satisfies the Kubernetes requirements.
